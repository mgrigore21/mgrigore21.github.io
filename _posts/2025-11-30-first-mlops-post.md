## Introduction

This is my first post about MLOps. I will cover what MLOps means, why it matters, and a simple checklist to get started.

### What is MLOps?

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of combining machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to automate and streamline the ML lifecycle — from data collection and model training to deployment and monitoring.

### Why it matters

- Ensures reproducible and reliable model deployments.
- Reduces time from prototype to production.
- Enables continuous improvement via monitoring and retraining.

### Simple MLOps checklist

1. Version your data and code.
2. Automate training and testing with CI/CD.
3. Containerize models for consistent deployment.
4. Implement model monitoring and alerting.
5. Automate retraining when performance degrades.

### Example pipeline (high level)

- Data ingestion → Data validation → Feature engineering  
- Model training → Model evaluation → Model packaging  
- Deployment (canary/blue-green) → Monitoring → Retraining

Short, practical notes like these help as reminders while building out a complete MLOps workflow.
